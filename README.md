DEAL is a social platform that helps you search and offer help for everyone's everday tasks.

## Prereqisites

In this project we utilize number of node.js tools to initializing and testing. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. Both are available under [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

You can access the project through download of a copy as well as by cloning via [git](http://git-scm.com/). You can clone it by typing the following commands:

```
git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/seba-master-2021/team-25/prototype.git

If you downloaded a copy of the project, make sure to unzip it and to navigate into the project root directory as follows:

```

### Install Dependencies

We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com). In the project root directory, type:

```
npm install
cd frontend

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
The app is ready to be deployed!
